# The Baseball Field

This is a rewrite and update of my site [thebaseballfield.se](https://www.thebaseballfield.se). 

The Git repository for that project can be found [here](https://github.com/JoakimJohnsson/tbf-firebase).

Using TypeScript instead of JavaScript, I hope to make the app (or apps...) perform and look better. And make the 
code more understandable and compact (...lots of refactoring). I also hope to learn more about TypeScript.
